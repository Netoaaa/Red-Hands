# Red Hands — Demo

Simple browser demo for the Red Hands canvas game.

Quick start

- Serve the folder and open `index.html` in a browser.

Using Python 3 built-in server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Controls
- `Space` — Player 1 action
- `Enter` — Player 2 action

Notes
- `game.js` is intended to run in a browser. If you open the file directly with a `file://` URL some browsers may restrict features; use a local server as above.
